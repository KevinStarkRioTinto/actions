# Actions
**Overview:**

This repository holds a collection of GitHub Actions I am currently working on as well as their statuses in the form of:
|Status|Description|Identifier|
|---|---|:---:|
|Concept|An Action in this state is currently in th early stages of it's development and shouldn't be used.  Contributions and collaboration are welcome.|:wrench:|
|Not-usable|An Action in this state has had it's development placed on hold and was left in an unusable state.  Contributions and collaboration are welcome.|:warning:	|
|Usable|An Action in this state may not be feature complete, but is complete enough to use in a workflow.  Be aware that bugs may exist.  Features may still be in development and contributions/collaboration are welcome.|:clapper:|
|Complete|An Action in this state is in maintenance mode.  Things will never be full finished and there is always room for improvement, but largely this Action will only change as it needs the GitHub Actions platform does.|:tada:|
